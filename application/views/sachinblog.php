                <p>JD(S), if allied with Congress for 2018, will be the biggest loser of Karnataka. This will be it’s last serious election. Of course it will certainly help Cong to retain power & will keep BJP out of power, but in next elections, state will become truly bipolar!</p>
                <p>Not to mention, the party will split before elections and half of its ranks & files will migrate to BJP! BJP will grow in a big way in south Karnataka if this happens!</p>
                <p>Updated seat ratings from Tumkur district:</p>
                <p>UPGRADE:</p>
                <p>Gubbi & Turuvekere from toss-up to Lean BJP</p>
                <p>DOWNGRADE:</p>
                <p>Net positive for BJP since Dec-Jan</p>
                <p>Overall,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BJP 5</li>
                    <li>Con 2</li>
                    <li>JDS 2</li>
                    <li>Toss-up  2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Banthanal Mutt & Babaleshwar Mutt have declared open war against M B Patil & have vowed to defeat him! More than half of all Lingayats in this AC follow these 2 mutts. On the other side, Mate Mahadevi & Jayamrutyunjaya Swami of Kudalasangama have thrown their weight behind Patil!</p>
                <p>M B Patil has apparently got negative response from Thontadarya Mutt and Chitradurga Brihanmutt to openly endorse him and to direct their subsidiaries to work for him in his constituency! Is these Mutts remain neutral, going gets tough for Patil. Only his 100 Crores can save him!</p>
                <p>After much pursuation, I’ve got voteshare details from the poll (Independent group) that I quoted last week. This is what the poll gives</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BJP 35.3%</li>
                    <li>Con 35.1%</li>
                    <li>JDS 17.6%</li>
                    <li>Oth  12%</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With almost similar vote spread as in past 3 assembly elections, this will easily translate into simple majority for BJP!</p>
                
                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">25 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Stand by for something big from Karnataka. Hint: it’s about a promise that I had made few days ago</p>
                <p>Concluded the data analysis of a small snap poll from Bijapur, Bagalkot & Dharwad districts about Lingayat religion issue that I’ve conducted. Will tweet the findings in this tweet series. Do follow the thread for more insights</p>
                <p>On Random sampling basis, responses were collected from 300 respondents belonging to Lingayat/Veerashaiva community from 3 districts of Bijapur, Bagalkot & Dharwad. The raw data has been weighed to match the gender & caste-wise breakdown of the actual Lingayat population</p>
                <p>Caste composition of the poll sample that was taken is as in the given chart. Overall composition of Lingayat-Veerashaiva population is somewhat similar to this. There is however, huge difference between composition in North, Central & South Karnataka districts</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture49.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>
                <p>Of this, Jangama, Sadaru and many Panchamasali &  Ganiga ardently follow Panchapeethas(Kashi, Ujjaini, Rambhapuri, Kedara, Shreeshaila) which are vehemently opposed to the move by state govt to separate Lingayats from Hindu religion & grant them minority status!</p>
                <p>In reality, there is no clarity as to which of the many sub sects identify themselves as Lingayat and which of them as Veerashaiva on the lines of the divide that the politicians have tried to engineer. In fact, most respondents say they are Veerashaiva-Lingayats!</p>
                <p>When asked, if they identify themselves as belonging to a Lingayat religion which is distinct from the Hindu religion, Only 12% said ‘Yes’! This must spell doom for those who calculated political gains in dividing a pious community of Karnataka</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture48.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>
                <p>The support for granting independent religion status for Lingayats in a population of exclusively Lingayat respondents is meagre 18%! Although further research was not possible due to lack of resources,  at the outset, most supporters of the move were traditional INC voters!</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture47.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>
                <p>Among various sub sects, slightly higher proportion of Panchamasalis(Vinay Kulkarni) and Kuduvokkaliga(MBPatil) Lingayats expressed support for independent religion status for Lingayats. Support for the same is almost non existent among Jangamas and Ganigas(BSY’s caste)</p>
                <p>Updated seat-ratings from Coastal Karnataka:</p>
                <p>UPGRADE: Mangalore city(S) from toss-up to Lean BJP, Puttur from Lean BJP to Safe BJP</p>
                <p>Outlook of all the seats in Udupi & North Canara district remain unchanged as <a href="https://twitter.com/snsachinnandu/status/949263483329118209?s=21" target="_blank">here</a> …</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">24 March 2018</h5>
                <p>In Belgaum south, sitting MLA Sambhaji Patil of MES has become very unpopular outside the ardent Marathi circles. BJP’s former MLA Abhay Patil is clear front runner to retake this seat. Cong will take the Muslim votes and maybe some Kannada votes but not enough to win!</p>
                <p>In Belgaum north, a tripolar battle has firmed up between BJP, Cong and MES. Cong sitting MLA Firoz Sait has a neutral image. Former Belgaum Mayor Renu Killekar & ex MLA Manohar Kinekar are competing for MES ticket. Despite a dozen aspirants & confusion about candt, BJP has edge!</p>
                
                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">23 March 2018</h5>
                <p>There is near total consolidation of STs behind BJP in Karnataka. It is true from Bellary to Gulbarga to Belgaum to Canara to Mysore! Expect 70-75% of all STs to go with the BJP. Cong’s efforts to project sugar barons Jarakiholis as successful leaders of STs has failed miserably!</p>
                
                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">22 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Bijapur city is all set to witness an epic battle. BJP’s ex MLA Appu Pattanashetty is readying ground to get ticket to take on Cong sitting MLA Maqbool Bagwan. Ex BJP man & former central minister BR Yatnal is also an aspirant- if BJP won’t give him ticket, might fight as ind!</p>
                <p>Several issues/people hv put a hold on Yatnal’s reentry into BJP. He’s an influential Lingayat leader, can influence outcome in 3-4 ACs! If he fights as an independent from Bijapur city, the contest will be very tough and the hugely unpopular Cong MLA might even scrape through!</p>
                <p>In Nagthana AC next door, the contest is again tripolar between sitting Cong MLA Raju Alagur(quite popular), JDS’ Devendra Chauhan & District BJP president & BSY loyalist Vitthal Katakadonda. Right hand Dalits, Lambanis & Lingayats will decide the victor. I see a slight BJP edge</p>
                <p>In Tikota, after having initial hiccups, irrigation minister and the chief conspirator of Lingayat movement, M B Patil has consolidated some ground over the past few months. BJP’s Vijugouda Patil who narrowly lost to MBP in 2013 on JDS ticket is putting up a spirited fight!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">21 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Kunigal has turned into a proper tripolar contest. Sitting MLA D Nagarajaiah of JDS will test his luck once again against his brother D Krishnakumar of BJP who had come 2nd in 08 & 13 and hence has sympathy in his favour this time around. 20k strong Lingayats are also with him!</p>
                <p>Two times former Cong MLA from Kunigal, B B Ramaswamy Gowda had come 3rd in 2013 behind BJP’s Krishna Kumar. Reason enough for DKShi brothers to pounce upon this constituency to install their cronies here. Two of their relatives are competing strongly with Gowda for Cong ticket.</p>
                <p>With 3-way split of the strong Vokkaliga vote bloc, Lingayats are likely to consolidate behind BJP. 30k+ strong Muslim voters will play a crucial role if OBC votes do not consolidate behind anyone. Overall, Kunigal is a very tough seat to predict as of now!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">20 March 2018</h5>
                <p>For all those interested in Karnatka elections, here’s a detailed breakdown of vote contributions of various vote blocs of the state. I have compiled this after going through authoritative & authentic literature. RT
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture2.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>
                </p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">19 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Although individually, the smaller OBC castes may not be big vote blocs. But together, Kumbara, Vishwakarma, Nekara, Yadava/Golla, Uppara, Eediga, Mogaveera, Kabbaliga, Balija, Maratha/Devadiga together constitute ~20% of the electorate in KA. All of them are pissed with Cong!</p>
                <p>Traditionally, BJP takes nearly 50% of these OBC/MBC/EBC votes. Which translates to roundly 10% of all all the votes. But with a peak anger against Cong & especially Sidramaiah, BJP might take time at least 70% of all these votes! Will be a big boost to  overall picture!</p>
                <p>Assuming a slightly lower turnout among these castes, BJP might end up with 12-13% of voteshare from just BCs. Assuming a lower than usual share from Lingayats of around 10%, 4% from STs, 4% from UCs, 6% from SCs and 1% from others, BJP is on course to poll 34-36% of total votes!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">18 March 2018</h5>
                <p>KA under @siddaramaiah has transformed into Gunda Raj. Even cops r beaten up, threatened & abused by both ruling class & mafia, commit suicides/get killed! Imagine the plight of common man. @RLR_BTM & before him @thekjgeorge have been the most incompetent HMs KA has ever seen!</p>
                <p>Lol. A R Krishnamurthy is son of A Rachayya, political guru of Siddaramaiah who is taking him in despite dissent from within Cong to honour his words to his Guru. Kollegal already has Cong MLA! Plus ARK was not announced as BJP candt. Also, he’s not the ONLY strong leader for BJP</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">15 March 2018</h5>
                <p>PWD Minister H C Mahadevappa, Sidramaiah’s closest friend! His son is under investigation in sand mafia case. Father-son duo are also known for receiving ‘cuts’ to approve projects as small as drainage to flyover to allotment of land. They’ve build a nexus of contractors/agents! https://twitter.com/moilyv/status/974322120586158080</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">14 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Sidramaiah’s confidante, 5 times MLA B R Yavagal had defeated BJP’s C C Patil from Nargund in 2013 with just about 8k votes. Patil was unable to be on the ground for campaign Coz he was shot and hospitalised 2 weeks before polls. Sympathy & caste eqns have made this seat Lean BJP</p>
                <p>Although Cong MLA has done a reasonable job, his disconnect with the ground is hurting him. Also, merger of BJP-KJP-BSRCP has taken BJP miles ahead of Cong in arithmetic. With consolidation of Lambani, Lingayat, ST & UC voters, BJP’s Ramanna Lamani is the favourite to win  here!</p>
                <p>Shirahatti in Gadag district had thrown one of the thinnest margin verdicts in 2013. BJP’s 2 times sitting MLA Ramanna Lamani had lost to Cong’s R Dodmani by just 315 votes. BSRCP’s Jayashree has taken over 26k votes resulting directly in Cong’s victory!</p>
                <p>Only fools can think that some far away bypolls result will force H D Devegowda to prostrate in front of Sonia Gandhi, her nearly 50 year old-still juvenile son and uncouth and arrogant Siddaramaiah!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">11 March 2018</h5>
                <p>This regional chauvinism thing in Karnataka is crossing all limits. Going by these run-amok morons who call themselves pro-Kannada activists(mostly funded by political party) K J George, Harris and many others shouldn’t even be in Karnataka assembly! Enough said!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">10 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Tumkur city has turned into a hot bed of political activity! Sitting Cong MLA Rafiq Ahmed has become largely unpopular. JDS & BJP both are brewing with infighting. Jyoti Ganesh, 2013 runner up(from KJP) is acing stiff competition from ex minister Sogadu Shivanna for BJP ticket.</p>
                <p>Most BJP cadres have shifted their allegiance to Jyoti Ganesh camp after KJP merger! Besides, Sogadu Shivanna is very unpopular. Ganesh is also the district BJP president and his father, G S Basavaraj is 4 times MP & a very influential Lingayat leader & BSY loyalist!</p>
                <p>With anti incumbency against sitting Cong MLA and a weak JDS, Jyoti Ganesh seems to be the best bet for BJP to recapture it’s lost citadel. Right now, I rate this seat as lean BJP.</p>
                <p>Cong has expelled Soubhagya Basavarajan, now ZP president & ex MLA with her husband Basavarajan, also as ex MLA for not giving up ZP president post as agreed. One of them wudv been Cong candidate for Chitradurga assembly seat. Now there are over a dozen aspirants for Con ticket!</p>
                <p>BJP has consolidated ground in Harihara. Incumbent JDS MLA H S Shivshankar seems to have lost ground & that has shifted to BJP. It’s a straight fight between Cong and BJP. Cong also struggling with candidate selection. Ex MLA B P Harish has best chances to win this seat for BJP!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">9 March 2018</h5>
                <p>This time, S N Subbareddy has moved to Cong pushing N Sampangi behind as the favourite to get Cong ticket! JDS might field Harinath Reddy. Actor Sai Kumar who had run on BJP ticket in 2008 and had come 4th just 6k votes behind the winner is likely to contest from BJP again.</p>
                <p>S N Subbareddy was elected with very high hopes and it seems like he hasn’t lived up to the expectations. But all his opponents are weaker than him. Gali Janardan Reddy apparently backs Saikumar from BJP and this makes the contest a very even triangular one. Toss-up as of now!</p>
                <p>Reddys(Vokkaligas) have dominated the political scenes of Chintamani in Chikkaballapura since forever! In 13 elections since 1957, Only Reddys have been elected as MLAs from here. M C Anjaneya Reddy was MLA in 1962 and then his son M Chowda Reddy became 5 times MLA & Minister.</p>
                <p>Chowda Reddy’s son Dr M C Sudhakar had then won twice in 04 & 08 from Cong & had lost with just 1.7k votes as an independent to JDS’ J K Krishna Reddy. Ex MLA K M Krishna Reddy’s daughter Vani Krishna Reddy was the Cong candidate, she was pushed to 3rd place.</p>
                <p>Fall out with K H Muniyappa and other Kolar-CBP Cong leaders forced Dr M C Sudhakar out of the party in 2013. Although there are talks of him going back to Cong as candidate, there are also rumours that he might join BJP. That will be a massive boost for BJP in this belt!</p>
                <p>Eitherways, sitting MLA J K Krishna Reddy has solidified his hold on Chintamani in the past 2-3 years. If M C Sudhakar joins BJP and Vani Krishna Reddy fights again from Cong, this is sure to turn into one hell of a contest! Overall, this edge to JDS as on now!</p>
                <p>Bagepalli in Chikkaballapura district is the only seat in the state where CPM ever made a mark! CPM’s G V Shrirama Reddy has won twice and emerged second 5 times. In 2013, S N Subbareddy won with over 31k votes as an independent pushing Cong siting MLA N Sampangi to 4th place!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">7 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Alcoholism is such a serious menace in Kolar-Chikkaballapura belt. Its like an epidemic here. Drunk men rolling by the side of the roads, women complaining about drunk husbands beating them up, snatching their hard earned money, children growing up in chaos r very usual scenes😞</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">6 March 2018</h5>
                <p>In Sidlaghatta, Chikkaballapura district. Very fluid and evolving political scenes here. Politics aside, just 1 hour away from the International Airport, 2 hours away from the capital, the town and taluk remains extremely backwards when it comes to development! Such a shame!</p>
                <p>There is almost criminal apathy by politicians about providing very basic amenities  to their constituents in the entire Kolar-Chikkaballapura belt. And people also keep electing the same useless crop of politicians over and over again. It’s just very very sad on so many levels😔</p>
                <p>Roads in dilapidated condition, villages after villages depending on nothing but sparingly(once in a week or 2)supplied tankers for water, no new industries coming up to provide jobs to growing young population & extremely backward sanitary conditions. This is all you get to see! This is especially true for taluks like Mulabagilu, Shidlaghatta, Bagepalli, Gudibande and Chintamani.</p>
                <p>In Chikkaballapura district where BJP is a very marginal player, Modi is admired by masses transcending caste divide and age groups! He’s largely seen as a poor people’s PM. Siddaramaiah has a neutral to negative image. It’s a wonder how BJP hasn’t paid attention to this region!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">5 March 2018</h5>
                <p>Congress could see a free fall in Bangalore if BJP holds on to the mementum that it has gained in the past 2 weeks. Even the so called safe seats such as Sarvagna Nagar, Shivajinagar and Shantinagar seem to be in play!</p>
                <p>Ashok Kheni, the extremely unpopular industrialist sitting MLA of Bidar South has joined Congress. He was on waitlist to join BJP for almost 3 months now and he was finally turned down apparently. As a last resort measure, he has jumped to Cong. Marriage of the desperate!</p>

                <p>This is the most ambitious route I’ve ever planned to cover large parts of the state. I might or might not do it, subject to availability of resources. But I really hope I will!

                <p>G S Patil of Cong is the incumbent MLA of Ron in Gadag district. He defeated BJP’s popular 2 terms MLA Kalakappa Bandi riding on anti incumbency wave & split of BJP vote base in 2013. This time the same to people are likely to face off & mood on ground has tilted in BJP’s favour!</p>
                <p>And before this, in early February, this is what I had covered- 40 assembly constituencies of 8 districts! Analysis of most of these constituencies can be found in my TL. This he’s been one hell of a month!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">28 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>In recent years, Pattanashetty’s relative Mahantesh Mamadapura has built his own base & emerged as runner up in 2013 fighting from JDS  pushing Pattanashetty to 3rd place. Now Mamadapura has also joined BJP. The tussle for ticket between these two is one of a kind in the state!</p>
                <p>On ground, it looks like Mamadapura has better chances to win on BJP ticket than Pattanashetty but party high command seems to be more sympathetic towards the latter. This has come as a boon for sitting Cong MLA Chimmanakatti who also has strong backing from his Kuruba community!</p>
                <p>If Mamadapura fights as an independent or from JDS and M K Pattanashetty fights as BJP candidate, likely that Cong will retain Badami. On the other hand, if BJP convinces Pattanashetty to give up the ticket to Mamadapura, it will become one hell of a contest to watch!</p>
                <p>Badami is witnessing very weird political headwinds. Almost 50% of the voters in this constituency are from either Kuruba or Lingayat community. A tussle between two powerful relatives inside BJP seems to have made incumbent Cong MLA B B Chimmankatti confident of another win!</p>
                <p>B B Chimmanakatti, the incumbent Cong MLA from Badami was first elected in 1978. Before him, K M Pattanashetty was a 2 terms MLA. In 80s, his son M K Pattanashetty entered politics and has been elected thrice since then. In 04 & 08, he was the BJP MLA from Badami!</p>
                <p>Although Kudalasangama, the heartland of Lingayat religion agitation is located in this very constituency, traction for the same on ground is almost absent- maybe the reason why Cong abandoned the cause! Lingayats who had voted for Cong heavily in 2013 are now back with BJP!</p>
                <p>Hungund in Bagalkot district has a high Muslim & Lingayat population. Kasheppanavar family has won 5 of the past 7 elections while BJP’s DG Patil had won in 04 & 08. In 13, young Vijayananda Kasheppanavar of Congres defeated BJP with over 15k votes.</p>
                <p>In 2013, 40k strong Muslim vote block had consolidated behind Congress. This time, AIMIM which has built a significant base in Ilkal is fielding a candidate! Besides this, Kasheppanavar is facing ire of the voters due to his arrogance & difficulty to reach while in need</p>
                <p>BJP is likely to repeat its 2 terms former MLA Doddanagouda Patil and Vijayananda Kasheppanavar will be the Cong candidate yet again. With a strong Muslim candidate in fray & return of the Lingayat voters to BJP’s fold, it will be a miracle if Congress retains this seat!</p>
                <p>In the past 11 elections since 1978, Only 2 families have controlled Muddebihal. Appaji Nadagouda, the incumbent MLA of Cong has won 6 terms and is fighting this time for the 7th! Former minister, 4 times mla & Janata Veteran Jagdevrao Deshmukh’s wife Vimala has lost 2 elections</p>
                <p>This time, Vimalabhai Deshmukh is unlikely to get the BJP ticket which is being contested by her & several others including Mangaladevi Biradar. Former Cong MLA from Bagewadi, A S Patil Nadahalli has left Cong and has announced to candidate from Muddebihal on JDS ticket!</p>
                <p>Nadagouda has several factors going against him including 6 terms anti incumbency! Muddebihal has turned into a hot triangular fight between Cong JDS & BJP. Its highly improbable at this moment to say who will win this contest. Things will get clearer with BJP candt announcement!</p>
                <p>One thing that is undeniable is that Karnataka is unbeatable when it comes to road indrastructure. Huge improvements in the past 1 year after completely ignoring it between 2013-16 and leading to breakdown of amazing road condition left by BJP govt in 2013.</p>
                <p>Lingsugur in Raichur before it was reserved for SCs in 2008, had groomed political heavyweights like Amaregouda Patil Bayyapura, Raja Amarappa Naik & Basavaraj Patil Anvari. In 2008, BJP’s Manappa Vajjal had won. In 2013 he was re-elected from JDS. But now he has come back to BJP</p>
                <p>Manappa’s return caused a rebellion within BJP. Siddu Bandi who came at close 3rd place on BSRCP ticket in 13 left BJP & is now JDS candidate. Cong is likely to repeat DS Hoilageri. BJP’s natural base along with Manappa Vajjal’s personal clout put this seat in arms reach for BJP!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">27 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Kushtagi in Koppal district is known for not electing anyone twice in a row. BJP’s incumbent MLA Doddanagouda Patil faces tough competition from Cong’s former MLA Amaregouda Bayyapura. Heavy Lingayat consolidation in favour of BJP is a factor that Cong needs to tackle to win here</p>
                <p>When BJP formed govt, Tangadagi became a minister. After his eventual fallout with BJP, he joined Cong, contested on Cong ticket in 2013 and scraped through purely due to vertical split of votes between KJP & BSRCP. Then KJP candidate Basavaraj Dhadesugur is a popular face now!</p>
                <p>Tangadagi’s arrogance, his disconnect with common voters & rampant corruption in the constituency has all led to a local antiicumbency against him. General mood against state govt has further compounded it. Only a BJP rebel can now save Tangadagi.</p>
                <p>Kanakagiri in Koppal district was reserved for SCs after 2008 delimitation. Erstwhile politicians of the region went into political oblivion & a new crop of young politicians have come up in Kanakagiri. In 08, young Shivaraj Tangadagi had rebelled against BJP & had won as an ind!</p>
                <p>In Sindhanur, Raichur district, it is the clash of the old rivals once again. Cong incumbent MLA Hampanagouda Badarli faces off JDS’ Venkatrao Nadagouda. Although BJP has been traditionally weak in Sindhanur, this time, party cadres are enthused. A tripolar seat as of now!</p>
                <p>In Raichur’s Manvi, there has been direct fight between Cong & JDS in the past 3 elections & it is no different this time. Cong will field it’s sitting MLA Hampayya Naik while Raja Venkatappa Naik fights from JDS. BJP might field ex MLA Gangadhar Naik. Cong-JDS fight here!</p>
                <p>Pratapgoud Patil had won on a BJP ticket from the newly formed Maski constituency in 2008. He had jumped to Cong in 2013 & had sailed through purely based on division of BJP-KJP-BSRCP votes! 10 years down the lane, he has come to be known as ‘percentage’ MLA in the constituency!</p>
                <p>Cong will field it’s incumbent once again but its a tricky game for BJP to choose between 3 aspirants in Maski- Mahadevappagouda, Basanagouda Turvihal and Rajashekhar Gouda. If BJP puts in a collective effort, it’s not hard at all to flip this seat! JDS is a marginal player here.</p>
                <p>In Raichur’s Devadurga, BJP’s incumbent MLA Shivangouda Naik is a household name. He had lost to his uncle, Venkatesh Naik of Cong in 2013 & then Raichur LS in 2014 with a very thin margin. But in 2016 bypolls following his uncle’s death, he stormed back with a thumping margin!</p>
                <p>Raichur MP B V Naik’s brother Rajashekhar Naik who had lost in 2016 bypoll is trying for the Congress ticket once again while CM is keen on fielding Someone from Venkatesh Naik’s family. JDS which was a strong force here is now mostly a marginal player. Overall, advantage BJP!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">26 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Surapur in Yadgir district is unique in that almost every second voter belongs to ST or SC communities! Cong’s Raja Venkatappa Naika is the incumbent MLA who had also won in 94 & 99. In 04 & 08, Raja Narasimha Naika had won who will be the BJP candidate this time.</p>
                <p>With almost vertical split of SC/ST voters, the next dominant Lingayat voters will decide the outcome. There seems to be disenchantment towards Incumbent Venkatappa Naika in the constituency and BJP’s Narasimha Naika is ahead of him at the moment!</p>
                <p>KJP’s Gurupatil had won Shahpur in Yadgir district in 2013 defeating Cong bigwig Sharanabasappa Patil Darshanapura. Although Gurupatil has lost most of the good will among voters, he will most likely be the BJP candidate and will face Darshanapura once again. Cong at advantage!</p>
                <p>While Congress leaders are busy parading around their boy-prince in a sleek air conditioned bus which most voters on ground call a “clown show”, Hyderabad Karnataka which in most part elected 7, 8, 9 term MLAs from Congres reeks of unemployment, poverty & lack of basic amenities!</p>
                <p>Jevargi is the stronghold of Cong veteran Dharam Singh & now his son Ajay Singh. In the past 10 elections, Dharam Singh had won in 8 of those before being defeated by political lightweight Doddappagouda Naribol of BJP by just 70 votes who was eventually defeated by Ajay in 2013!</p>
                <p>After the death of Dharam Singh, Cong hold on Jewargi has slipped a little. BJP has regrouped & reenergised. Once again, DP Naribol might get the ticket. JDS has fielded the much respected Kedaralingayya, a local grassroots leader. Ajay Singh might scrape through amidst all this!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">25 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Political equations have changed in Gulbarga Rural now. Cong might field G Ramakrishna’s son in stead of his father coz of his ill health. Although 2013 faultlines within saffron camp still exist with both Belamagi & Chauhan trying hard to get the ticket, BJP is favourite to win!</p>
                <p>Congress’ G Ramakrishna had won Gulbarga Rural constituency in 2013 purely based on a vertical split of BJP-KJP votes. Former minister Revunaik Belamagi the then BJP candidate had lost with a margin of under 8k votes while KJP candidate Baburao Chauhan had polled over 26k votes!</p>
                <p>Gulbarga South has witnessed 3 elections since 2008 when the constituency was formed. In 08, C D Patil Revoor had won on BJP ticket. In 2010 bypolls necessitated by his death, his wife Aruna had won on JDS ticket. In 2013, her son Dattatreya Patil Revoor was elected on BJP ticket</p>
                <p>Many were sceptical about the political abilities of  Dattatreya when BJP fielded him in 13. But he has proven everyone wrong & has solidified his hold on the constituency. Ex minister Allamaprabhu Patil and a host of others are trying for Cong ticket. BJP is ahead as of now!</p>
                <p>Gulbarga North is witnessing a very fluid political situation on ground with little clue as to which was the wind is blowing. Cong veteran Qamar-ul-Islam’s death has left the party in shambles. Naseer Hussain who was 2013 runner up on KJP ticket is now running on JDS ticket!</p>
                <p>Someone from Qamarul’s family might get Cong ticket. AIMIM is also likely to field a candt. Shashil Namoshi, Rajagopal Reddy & a host of others are vying for BJP ticket which they think will help then sail through in a multipolar fight with 4 strong M candts! A thorough toss-up!</p>
                <p>Chincholi in Gulbarga district is the constituency of veterans of Karnataka politics like former CM Veerendra Patil, former ministers Vaijanath Patil & Kailashnath Patil until delimitation in 2008 when it became an SC reserves seat!</p>
                <p>Although the incumbent MLA of Chincholi Dr Umesh Yadav of Cong is not very popular, the local dynamics are favourable for the Cong. BJP’s former MLA & Minister Sunil Valyapure seems to be the only candidate who has any chance at defeating Cong.</p>
                <p>Bidar South is currently represented by industrialist Ashok Kheni who has become so unpopular that he might be pushed to 4th place! Clean and popular Doctor Shailendra Beldale is the ideal candidate for BJP. JDS’ Bandeppa Khashempur has heated up the contest even more! Adv BJP!</p>
                <p>Bidar North constituency is up for an epic fight between Cong and BJP. Considerable Muslim voters make it a favourable seat for Cong. However, If BJP declares Suryakanth Nagamarpalli, son of veteran leader Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli as its candidate, seat will tilt in its favour!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">24 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>JDS’ Mallikarjun Khuba had won from Basavakalyana in Bidar district in 2013 amidst split of votes between BJP, KJP & BSRCP. He had lost to BJP’s Basavaraj Patil Attur in 2008. Khuba is unlikely to contest on JDS ticket this time and might migrate to Cong if assured of ticket!</p>
                <p>BJP faces tough task of candidate selection amongst 3 strong names- Lingaraj Patil Attur(son of ex minister B P Attur), M G Mule(2013 BSRCP candidate & ex MLA) & Sanjay Patwari(of RSS background & 2013 BJP candidate). With a united front, it looks like BJP can snatch this seat!</p>
                <p>A small town on the banks of meandering Bhima river, Afzalpur is known for gang wars & shootings! The politics of this land is also tainted with blood. Cong’s Malikayya Guttedar controls this constituency with an iron fist. However, a visible disenchantment has set in against him</p>
                <p>Malikayya Guttedar, who has won every election since 1985 except 2004 when Janata veteran M Y Patil defeated him on JDS ticket. Losing ZP/TP polls to BJP has dealt a blow to him in the constituency. His traditional opponent MLA M Y Patil will be the BJP candidate. A close tie!</p>
                <p>Aland is witnessing an epic battle of the traditional rivals B R Patil & Subhash Guttedar. Both have been MLAs for 3 terms each in the past 3 decades. B R Patil who had won on KJP ticket in 13 has jumped to Cong & Guttedar who was in JDS has joined BJP. BJP has a slight edge!</p>
                <p>Sindgi is the only seat in Vijayapura district to have voted for BJP in last 3 consecutiv elections. Incumbent MLA Ramesh Bhusanur is reasonably popular. His opponent M Managuli of JDS who had won in 94 has been a runner up in every election since then, losing out narrowly in 13!</p>
                <p>M Managuli is on his last try from JDS to finally win back the seat that he had won more than 2 decades ago. Micro anti incumbency against the BJP MLA has set-in in pockets, especially in Sindgi town. Cong is not sure of its candidate still. It’s a tough triangular call as of now</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">23 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Devara Hipparagi assembly constituency in Bijapur district was formed after delimitation in 2008. Both in 08 & 13, A S Patil Nadahalli had won this constituency on Cong ticket. With him now in JDS and migrating to neighbouring Muddebihal, this seat has completely opened up!</p>
                <p>Cong’s sitting MLA from Basavana Bagewadi S S Patil met with tough resistance when he tried to jump the ship to BJP, feeling jittery of his position. After he abandoned those plans, now it’s a tough fight between him and BJP’s S K Bellubbi. Bellubbi has the edge at the moment!</p>
                <p>Check this about Belgaum district politics. Have tried to give as detailed account as possible!

                <p>Jamakhandi in Bagalkot district is one of the 2 difficult seats for the BJP to crack. Cong MLA Siddu Nyamagauda is a popular name with good grip on the constituency through his co-op affairs. In 04 & 08, BJP had won this seat with decisive margins but pushed to 3rd place in 2013!</p>
                <p>In 2004, Siddu Savadi had won Jamakhandi for the first time for BJP with a big margin. After reorganisation, he migrated to the newly created Teradal seat. In 2008, BJP’s Srikant Kulkarni defeated Cong’s Siddu Nyamgauda. But in 2013, he trailed behind independent J Gudagunti!</p>
                <p>BJP is elusive about the winning candidate among 2013 Ind runner up Jagadish Gudagnti, ex MLA Srikant Kulkarni, 2013 KJP candidate Umesh Mahabalashetti who had polled 15k votes. BJP Bigwig former minister Murugesh Nirani’s brother seems to be the dark horse to defeat Nyamgauda!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">22 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Teradal in Bagalkot district is throwing challenge to Siddaramaiah’s AHinDa formulation. Sitting MLA, Minister Umashree, despite being from the biggest vote block of Nekars(weavers) is struggling to hold on to its ground. BJP’s Siddu Savadi is the hot favourite to win this seat!</p>
                <p>BJP’s tallest Dalit face in the state, Govind Karajol represents Mudhol in Bagalkot district. His traditional opponent R B Timmapura, who, despite losing last time has become a minister in Siddu cabinet as an MLC-shows how influential he is!</p>
                <p>This time too, it will be a contest between the same two veterans in Mudhol! There’s a very split environment in the constituency with voters in  Mudhol town mostly backing Timmapur and most villages backing BJP solidly- overall a pretty good edge to BJP’s Karjol at the moment!</p>
                <p>Ramadurga is a key swing seat in Mumbai Karntaka. Incumbent MLA Ashok Pattan of Cong has won both 2008 & 13 with razor thin margins against BJP’s Mahadevappa Yadawad who had defeated Pattan in 2004! The victory margin in 13 was <5k while the KJP candidate had polled 16k votes!</p>
                <p>Although he won mostly due to the divided BJP, Ashok Pattan as chief whip of the state govt and in his personal capacity as an MLA, has brought many projects to Ramadurga and has improved his image among the voters! Irrespective of BJP candt, he enjoys a very thin edge!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">21 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Bailahongala in Belgaum district has turned into a BJP fortress since 2008. The last time a Cong candidate had won from here was over 3 decades ago! In 2013, KJP’s Dr VI Patil had defeated BJP’s Jagadeesh Metgud with 3k votes, BJP & KJP together had cornered over 60% of the votes</p>
                <p>From 85 to 04, Kaujalagi family held Bailahongala under Janatadal banner & later under its splinter JDU(in alliance with BJP). Shivanand Kaujalgi’s younger son Basavaraj Kaujalagi ran unsuccessfully in 08 and 13 on Congress ticket, the family’s influence has largely diminished!</p>
                <p>Amidst brewing confusions around Congress ticket, BJP too is threatened with ugly faction friction. Both former MLA Jagadeesh Metgud and sitting MLA V I Patil are equally strong. Irrespective of all that, Bailahongala remains one of the safest seats for BJP in Mumbai Karnataka!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">20 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Babugouda personally oversaw most works on the ground along with day to day interaction with cadres! D B Inamdar who is mostly disconnected from the ground has declared himself as Cong candidate. Babugouda is all set to join BJP and compete with Suresh Marihal for party ticket!</p>
                <p>Congress stands any chance at defending Kittur seat only if it pacifies Babugouda Inamdar and either gives him party ticket or at least convinces him against contesting on  BJP ticket. Even with Suresh Marihal as its candidate, BJP is a favourite to win this crucial seat!</p>
                <p>Kittur in Belgaum district has emerged as a very interesting seat. Cong’s sitting MLA D B Inamdar had defeated BJP’s 2 times MLA Suresh Marihal with over 17k votes in 2013. Inamdar’s son in law Babugouda was instrumental in his victory. BJP-KJP split had also helped Congress!</p>
                <p>Koppal MP Karadi Sanganna for Koppal assembly seat, Mysore MP Pratap Simha for Hunsur seat, Udupi-Chikmagalur MP Shobha Karandlaje for Udupi seat should be considered for sure other than of course BSY who’s the incumbent MP from Shimoga.</p>

                <p>JDS has released candidates list for 39 of the 90 seats of North Karnataka. If JDS has to cross 50 mark, they have to win at least 10 seats here- which is honestly hard! But here are the serious contenders among these 39 declared candidates(not saying all these will win):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Muddebihal-AS Patil</li>
                    <li>Nagthana-S Chauhan</li>
                    <li>Sindhgi-MC Manguli</li>
                    <li>Jevargi-Kedaralingayya</li>
                    <li>Bidar(S)-Bandeppa Khashempur</li>
                    <li>Manvi-R V Naika</li>
                    <li>Sindhnur-V Nadagouda</li>
                    <li>Navalgund- NS Konreddi</li>
                    <li>Kundagol-MS Akki</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Yes only 9 of the 39 JDS candts from NK r in serious contention!</p>
                <p>In another Muslim dominated constituency of Gulbarga North, JDS has fielded corporator Nasir as its candidate. Along with Someone from the family of deceased Cong Minister Qamarul Islam, there will be 2 other Muslim candidates-from SDPI & MIM. Interesting multipolar fight!</p>
                <p>In Tumkur Rural, JDS has fielded Gourishankar, son of former minister K C Chennigappa(the family had left JDS to join BJP briefly in 2009 and thereafter had returned to JDS). Now between him, Cong & BJP’s sifting MLA Suresh Gowda, Tumkur rural has emerged as a tripolar contest!</p>
                <p>In Sirsi, JDS has declared Shashibhushan Hegde, the grandson of Ramakrishna Hegde(the former CM of Karntaka) as its candidate from Sirsi, yet again. Between him, Cong and BJP’s Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, this has emerged as a tripolar contest!</p>
                <p>Siddaramaiah’s one time friend G T Devegauda(sitting MLA) will be the JDS candidate from Chamundeshwari constituency in Mysore. He will face CM Siddaramaiah in a very tough battle! Will be a bomb of a contest to watch!</p>
                <p>Former Mysore MP H Vishwanath who recently left Cong for JDS wil be JDS candidate from the battleground Hunsur seat! If Pratap Simha gets the BJP ticket, this will emerge as one of the most interesting tripolar contests in the entire state! Cong’s H P Manjunath is the sitting MLA</p>
                <p>JDS has fielded local leader Abdul from the Muslim dominated Narasimharaja Constituency in Mysore city. That makes it 3 Muslim candidates-sitting MLA, Minister Tanveer Sait, an SDPI candidate and now a JDS candidate. Suddenly BJP is in the fight from here!</p>
                <p>JDS’ Mandya MP C S Puttaraju to contest from Melukote assembly constituency. Farmer rights activist K S Puttanayya is the sitting MLA. Puttaraju has in the past won from this seat(2008) but had lost to Puttannayya in 2013, then went on to fight 2014 LS and defeated Cong’s Ramya!</p>
                <p>From fresh re-assessment of each seat of North Karnataka in Jan-Feb, here are the updated seat-ratings for all 12 districts:</p>

                <p>Total seats 90</p>
                <p>Safe BJP 7(-12)</p>
                <p>Lean BJP 36(+5)</p>
                <p>Toss-up 24(+7)</p>
                <p>Lean Con 20(+3)</p>
                <p>Safe Con 3(0)</p>
                <p>(Change sine Nov-Dec/2017)</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">16 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>#KarnatakaElections</p>
                <p>Districts where BJP is performing better than expected: Raichur, Chitradurga, Gulbarga, Bidar, Mysore, North karnataka</p>
                <p>Districts where it’s performing worse than expected: Belgaum, Vijayapura, Bellary, Tumkur, Shimoga</p>
                <p>(Baseline is my assessment from Nov-Dec 17)</p>
                <p>Overall, at this point, 25-26 looks like a realistic figure for the BJP from Mumbai Karnataka. If they want to win the state, these numbers are not enough!</p>
                <p>In Bijapur district, BJP faces different challenges! The chaos that has ensued with the number of contenders in each seat, internal sabotage and fights within the district unit can all jeopardise BJP’s chances! From 1/8 in 2013, it has to win at least 4 to stay in the race!</p>
                <p>Mumbai Karntaka is turning into the real battleground region district by district. BJP is facing issues internal and external and if they’re not sorted in mission mode, it’ll be hard for BJP to cross 26-27 mark from the 50 seats in the region!</p>
                <p>In crucial Belgaum district with 18 seats, although BJP started on a high, internal rifts & too many big leaders all opposed to each other’s interests is hurting the party. It’s more or less Umesh Katthi+Balachandra Jarakiholi vs Laxman Savadi+Jolle couple. Can pull down BJP!</p>
                <p>Of the 18 seats in the district(Belgaum), in 2013, BJP had won 8 seats(+1 KJP+1 BSRCP). If BJP puts up a united front, they can win as much as 13-14 seats! But with current situation, defending even those 10 seats would be hard!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">13 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>In Haveri, it’s a battle of the equals. Resurgent BJP and formidable Congress have locked horns in a very tough fight. Minister Rudrappa Lamani and former MLA and BSY loyalist Nehru Olekar are sweating it out to the last street and village. BJP seems to have a very thin edge!</p>
                <p>One common pattern that I have observed from Belgaum to North Canara to Shimoga to Chitradurga to Davangere to Haveri- Modi’s personal popularity is largely intact and for Loksabha, irrespective of the outcome of assembly elections, BJP is the first choice!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">11 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Hiriyur is one constituency where Congress and JDS both have had substantial influence with BJP always struggling to make its mark. This time, it’s a tough tripolar contest between Cong’s Sudhakar, BJP’s Shrinivas and JDS’ Manjunath(or whoever that party fields)</p>
                <p>ST reserved Challakere in Chitradurga district is shaping up into an interesting battle. Incumbent MLA T Raghumurthy is facing tough competition from actor Shashikumar for Cong ticket. BJP’s K T Kumaraswamy & JDS’ Patel Tippeswamy are locked in with Con in a tough tripolar!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">10 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Holalkere in Chitradurga district is a hot battleground seat. Social welfare minister and Siddu’s trusted aide H Anjaneya has become unpopular in the constituency. BSY loyalist, BJP’s M Chandranna has an initial upper hand. Entry of many new candidates has complicated the scene!</p>
                <p>Had to hurry through Bhadravati & Tarikere constituencies. General mood in Bhadravati is very divided between incumbent MLA M J Appaji of JDS & Cong’s B K Sangameshwar. In Tarikere, the general mood is in favour of BJP. It will be an easy win if former MLA Suresh gets BJP ticket!</p>
                <p>Shimoga Rural should’ve been a Prime pick-up seat for BJP this time but due to confusions surrounding the candidate selection is hurting the party. Incumbent JDS MLA Sharada Purya Naik is from the right branch of SCs and is putting up good fight. Only United BJP can defeat her!</p>
                <p>Channagiri in Davangere district is a key swing seat. Incumbent MLA Vadnal Rajanna of Cong faces his traditional rival Madal Virupakshappa of BJP who had lost in 2013 on KJP ticket with a paper thin margin. This time the seat seems to be tilted in favour of BJP!</p>
                <p>Shimoga assembly constituency is witnessing strange political strides. Political Paperweight K B Prasanna Kumar of Congress, who was lucky to win in 2013 purely due to a vertical split in BJP votes is putting up a spirited fight against BJP. BJP’s ranks are still divided!</p>
                <p>BSY loyalist Rudre Gowda & ex Dy CM K S Eshwarappa are at each other’s throats to secure the party ticket from Shimoga city seat. Unless there’s a consensus candidate and entire party works, Prasanna Kumar is not a pushover! Alarm bells for @BSYBJP</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">9 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Yesterday’s route map that I covered. It was very tiring but a very interesting trail across the green belt of Karnataka. I covered 5 assembly constituencies and touched on 2 more. Khanapur, Haliyal, Yallapur, Sirsi, Soraba, Shikaripura & Sagara! More exciting day ahead</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture29.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>
                <p>Kagodu Timmappa, the tallest minister in Siddu cabinet is so unpopular in his constituency that anyone with brains inside Cong would convince him to not contest! BJP’s ex MLA from Soraba, H Halappa will most likely run from BJP. Ex MLA Gopalkrishna might damage BJP!</p>
                <p>In heart of Malnad- Soraba! Ex CM Bangarappa’a sons have locked horns in a nail biting contest. Kumar fights on BJP ticket while Madhu is the incumbent JDS MLA. Ex BJP MLA Halappa’s backing makes otherwise lacklustre Kumar a strong contender to the seat! Very interesting fight!</p>
                <p>In Sirsi, BJP strongman Vishweshwar Hegde kageri is pitted against Shashibhushan Hegde, grandson of Ramakrishna Hegde in a stiff contest! Kageri has done exemplary works in the constituency and iswidely respected. Split in havyaka Brahmin votes can hurt him though!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">8 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>Haliyal in North Canara district is one of the most prestigious and hottest seats this time! Industries minister and Congress veteran R V Deshpande is facing a very tough fight from BJP’s Sunil Hegde. Despite much development work, Deshpande is facing a lot of heat!</p>
                <p>Early start to the day! In Khanapur, the Marathi bastion of Belgaum. Sitting MLA Arvind Patil of MES has moved towards BJP, Cong fielding wife of ex cop Hemant Nimbalkar. MES to field a fresh face! Tough tripolar contest on cards with an early edge to BJP!</p>
                <p>In Arabhavi, Balachandra Jarakiholi is absolutely undefeatable. Whether he contests on BJP ticket or goes to Cong or fights as an independent, there’s no one in the constituency who can defeat him! Talk in the constituency is that he is suffocated inside BJP.</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">7 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>BJP’s Raju Bharamagouda Kage had won Kagawada General constituency in 2013 against all odds. His opponent Shrimanth Patil who had contested on JDS ticket & lost with thin margin last time is the Cong candidate this time. It’s a tough call with an early edge to Cong!</p>
                <p>Now in BJP strongman Umesh Katthi’s constituency Hukkeri in belgaum district. There’s no election fever here. The result is a long foregone conclusion. He’s absolutely invincible in his constituency!</p>
                <p>In Yamakanamaradi, Belgaum- Cong minister and strongman Satish Jarakiholi’s constituency. BJP has consolidated some ground since I was last here but still difficult to defeat Satish! BJP is tapping his cousin Lakhan Jarakiholi to take on the sugar baron!</p>
                <p>Sugarcane is a big big issue in Belgaum district. As much as Siddu is trying to encash on it, farmers mostly credit central govt for improved pricing & bill settlements. Both parties have hold on sugar factories in the district but Cong(Prakash Hukkeri & Jarakiholis) has an edge.</p>
                <p>Eldest of the Jarakiholis, Ramesh has held Gokak for almost 2 decades. Despite good development track record, It’s a hot battleground seat this time. BJP’s Ashok Pujari is a household name in the constituency now. But Jarakiholis have consolidated over the past month!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">5 Feb 2018</h5>
                <p>In response to Congress’ game of inducting strongmen B Nagendra & Anand Singh, BSY-Sriramulu-Reddy family have played all the right pawns by getting two big shots into BJP. With a sure footed strategy, BJP can win 5-7 seats in Bellary district!</p>
                <p>Royal Family Scion and long time Congress loyalist M Y Ghorpade’s son Kartikeya has now joined BJP. E Tukaram of Cong had won for 3 consecutive terms from Sandur in Bellary district with the support of Ghorpade family. Another good catch for the BJP in Bellary!</p>
                <p>Veteran Congress leader Gaviyappa, ex MLA from Hospet in Bellary district has joined BJP. He was defeated by Anand Singh of BJP in the past two elections. Anand Singh is now in Congress. Complete transposition! The seat has opened up again for the BJP now!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">5 Jan 2018</h5>
                <p>With its 19 seats, the 3 districts of coastal Karnataka play a crucial role in deciding who ascends to throne in Bangalore. BJP’s erstwhile fortress was thoroughly captured by Cong in 2013. BJP had collapsed to a meagre 3 seats while Cong had swept the region by winning 13 seats</p>
                <p>This was the only region of the state where the BJP had lost the day due to real anger of the electorate against the BJP for failing to give a stable government and not due to the vote-split between BJP & KJP. Congress became the direct beneficiary of the anti-incumbency vote!</p>
                <p>As the Hindutva heartland of the south, this region had given the first base for the BJP and Jansangh before that in Karnataka. BJP has won all 3 Loksabha seats of the coast consistently since 1999. This is the strongest base for Sangh and it’s subsidiaries in the state!</p>
                <p>Demographically, UCs, Billavas, Bunts, Idigas, Devadigas, SCs, Muslims, Christians, STs(in North Canara) form the biggest voting blocs although in this election, religion based voting is likely to transcend caste based pattern!</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture36.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>

                <p>Despite their worst ever drubbing in 2013, BJP performed impressively in the 2014 Loksabha election when they took lead in 17 of the 19 seats(baring Mangalore and Haliyal)</p>
                <p>In the changed political scenario, 5 years later, all the factors which worked for Cong have dissipated. Religious polarisation following murders of more than a dozen Hindu activists and state govt’s friendly treatment of PFI/SDPI has galvanised anger against Congress govt!</p>
                <p>Inability of sitting Cong MLAs to bring many significant Infra projects to the region is also hurting the ruling party along with disconnect of most of the sitting MLAs with the ground.</p>
                <p>Although Cong boasts of tall leaders like RV Deshpande, UT Khader, Ramanath Rai, Vasantha Bangera, Gopal Pujari, Abhayachandra et al, the wrong policies & strategies of Cong have left a large chunk of their cadre/workers disillusioned and disinterested to work for the elections.</p>
                <p>Although BJP starts on high, there are issues that can hurt the saffron party. The disillusionment from the previous tenure of BJP of 2008-13 among voters has still not completely disappeared. BJP faces trust issues in the region when it comes to governance & delivery on promises</p>
                <p>Besides this, BJP also faces problem of too many or no proper candidates on some seats including Udupi, Puttur and Karwar. JDS mostly is a marginal player in the coast and has no base to even retain deposits in any seat in Udupi or South Canara districts!</p>
                <p>In North Canara too, most of the local leaders of JDS have left the party to join BJP including ex MLA of Haliyal Sunil Hegde who had defeated Cong bigwig RV Deshpande in 2008!</p>
                <p>With all that background, here’s an attempt to rate each of the 19 seats of 3 coastal districts. The political scenes in the coast are still evolving and clearer picture will emerge in the coming weeks and as the Election Day nears!</p>

                <p>Very popular and respected BJP MLA Nemiraj Naik had lost this seat by just about 1000 votes in 2013. This is one of the prime pick up seats for the BJP in 2018!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">2 Jan 2018</h5>
                <p>Bellary is one of the bigger districts with a broad geographical spread with its dusty terrain and thatched roads from the huge trucks plying the mine dust, scorching heat, water scarcity and never ending clout of mine bosses in the district politics!</p>
                <p>In 2008, buoyed by the tremendous clout of the Reddy family of Bellary, BJP had swept the district winning 8 of the 9 seats, most seats with big margins! All 8 MLAs were Reddy family loyalists. Cong’s erstwhile bastion was decimated!</p>
                <p>Results of previous assembly elections in Bellary district:</p>

                <p>2004</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BJP 3</li>
                    <li>JDS 3</li>
                    <li>Con 1</li>
                    <li>Ind 1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2008</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BJP 8</li>
                    <li>Con 1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2013</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Con 4</li>
                    <li>BSR 2</li>
                    <li>BJP 1</li>
                    <li>JDS 1</li>
                    <li>Ind 1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Demographically, the district has one of the largest ST populations in the state, and sizeable SC population. Only 2 of the 9 seats(Bellary City & Vijayanagara) in the district are unreserved. 5 are reserved for STs and 2 for SCs!!</p>
                <p>Apart from SCs and STs who constitute over 40% of all the voters in the district, Lingayats, Kurubas and Muslims form next big vote blocks. Numerous middle caste groups form the usually floating vote groups which are crucial for the victory of any party/candidate!</p>
                <p>More than party, personal clout of the candidates matters in the district. For e.g., Kudligi MLA B Nagendra has won on BJP ticket and as an independent and this time is looking to fight on Cong ticket, and seems to be the front runner in his constituency irrespective of party!</p>
                <p>Similarly, Vijayanagar MLA Anand Singh, Bellary city MLA Anil Lad, Hadagali MLA PT Parameshwar Naik, Sandur MLA E Tukaram, all mostly win with their personal clout.</p>
                <p>What worked against the BJP in 2013 was that the party was ambandoned by both B Sriramulu who formed his own BSRCP and by Reddy family who remained out of politics as Gali Janardhar Reddy was in jail facing trial in DA cases!</p>
                <p>This time around, B Sriramulu is back in the BJP and the Reddy family is also partly back in the picture trying to influence the choice of candidates in some seats and trying to secure a seat or two for the family itself!</p>
                <p>Cong’s sitting MLAs have become unpopular with the masses as I have observed from my interactions. It’s now sacked Minister PTP Naik of Hadagali is by far the most unpopular! Bellary MLA NY Gopalakrishna is an outsider to the district that won the bypoll after BSR resigned</p>
                <p>Bellary city MLA Santosh lad and Siragupa MLA BM Nagaraj, both mine Barons are on sticky wickets with BSR, Reddy family and BJP all 3 are back in the same mix! Only person seem to be relatively insulated from all this is Sandur MLA Tukaram(who also has his own issues!)</p>
                <p>Possible/winnable candidates from the BJP:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vijayanagara-Anand Singh</li>
                    <li>Bellary-J Shantha/B Sriramulu himself</li>
                    <li>Bellary city-Somashekhar Reddy</li>
                    <li>Siraguppa-Somalingappa</li>
                    <li>Kampli-Suresh Babu</li>
                    <li>Hadagali-Bhimanaik/Madhunaik</li>
                    <li>HBHalli-Nemirajanaik</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is how the seats of Bellary district look like as of today: it is completely possible for the BJP to repeat 2008 performance however it cannot he ruled out that Cong might regain some of the ground in coming months and make it an equal game!</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Shimoga Chikmangur analysis</p>
                <p>In 2008, BJP had swept this belt bagging 10 of the 12 seats. In 2004 too, BJP had won 10 seats. It was an unquestionable saffron fortress until 2013 when BSY’s KJP pulled it down to 2 seats! KJP itself had won a seat and had come 2nd in 7 seats!</p>
                <p>The hold that BS Yadyurappa wields in these two districts is unmatched in political history of the region! From APMCs to Panchayatis to ULBs to DCC bank, his followers dominate the political scene in two districts.</p>
                <p>The combination of age old Hindutva, high UC population, high Lingayat population and BSY’s personal clout makes this belt ripe for another BJP sweep. That said, there are inherent challenges too which the saffron party has to address. JDS Top has a sizeable presence here</p>
                <p>BJP suffers from the problem of too many candidates in several constituencies and this might turn out to be a nightmare. Besides that, BJP has no sizeable presence or good candidates in Bhadravati and Kadur seats, incidentally the only seats where BJP is unable to make gains now!</p>
                <p>To everyone’s surprise, JDS had won 5 of the 12 seats in these 2 districts. Baring Bhadravati and Kadur the other three were incidental gains due to vote-split. This time around, JDS might be lucky to retain even one of those 5 seats that it had won on 2013!</p>
                <p>In 2014 Loksabha, BJP had taken unassailable leads in 11 of the 12 constituencies(baring Kadur which falls under Hassan PC where Devegauda was the candidate). In fact even in Bhadravati where BJP has never won as assembly election, BJP got lead of over 10k votes!</p>
                <p>Demographically, Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Dalits and UCs form the biggest vote blocks in Shimoga-Chikmagalur. Large Muslim populations wed influence in Shimoga city, Chikmagalur town and Bhadravati town! Winning combination with the BJP though</p>
                <p>Probable(winnable candidates-based on my travels/interactions) for Shimoga District:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shimoga-K S Eshwarappa/Rudre Gowda</li>
                    <li>Shimoga Rural-Basavanneppa/KG Kumaraswamy/KE Kanthesh(KSE’s son)</li>
                    <li>Soraba-K Bangarappa/H Halappa</li>
                    <li>Sahara-H Halappa/B Gopalkrishna</li>
                    <li>Thirthahalli- Araga Gnyanendra</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Shikaripura-Anyone that BSY’s anoints/BSY himself</p>
                <p>Bhadravati-None as of now/JDS MLA Appaji is apparently in talks with BJP!</p>
                <p>Chikmagalur-CT Ravi</p>
                <p>Sringeri-Jeevaraj</p>
                <p>Mudigere-MP Kumaraswamy</p>
                <p>Tarikere-DS Suresh</p>
                <p>Kadur-None as of now, BJP has little chance to win this seat!</p>
                <p>With all that background analysis, here’s the seat ratings for Shimoga-Chikmagalur districts. It’s BJP’s battle to lose here! Winning 10/12 is absolutely imperative for the saffron party to gain simple majority in the state!</p>

                <h5 class="blogdate" style="">27 Dec 2018</h5>
                <p>Davangere District largely heralds the political mood in Karnataka. In 2008, riding on BSY wave, BJP had won 6 of the 8 seats, while in 2013, it was reduced to Zero. KJP had polled twice as many votes as BJP and had lost Channagiri, Mayakonda & Honnali from a striking distance!</p>
                <p>The split in votes between BJP & KJP led to straight Cong victory in 5 of the 8 seats while the 2 Davangere city seats were won default by Cong making its tally a whopping 7/8 with a razor thin, unexpected loss in Harihara to JDS!</p>
                <p>The most notable point about this district is the extent to which Lingayats can singlehandedly decide the winner in most of the seats. Although Cong’s tallest Lingayat leader S Shivashankrappa is from here, his influence is limited to the city. BSY unquestionably overshadows him!</p>
                <p>In 2013, what worked against the BJP has largely been reversed. What worked FOR the Cong has largely been eroded except of course the personal clout of SS & his son in the city! Nearly 100% of all UCs & a significant proportion of OBCs seem have moved towards the BJP!</p>
                <p>One thing that can hurt the BJP though is the disgruntled lot within Old BJP which is miffed with BSY for handing out tickets in most seats to those who came back from KJP- MP Renukacharya(Honnali), Madal Vitupakshappa(Channagiri), BP Harish(Harihara) & SV Ramachandra(Jagalur).</p>
                <p>But it should be borne in mind that these are the only winnable candidates that BJP has in these seats and these internal skirmishes will probably die down closer to the elections. In a way, BSY announcing the candidates early gives them time to sort out issues with rivals!</p>
                <p>As it stands today, Cong stands to lose most of the gains that it made in 2013. Remember, in 2013, BJP did not win any seat and Cong took home 7/8! Here’s what it looks like today</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="<?= base_url('images/blogs/Picture43.png'); ?>" alt="Crowd Prediction"></div>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Koppal & Raichur Districts</p>
                <p>Koppal & Raichur districts share several common features. A very fractured, volatile & ever changing political atmosphere which almost always is Tripolar/Multipolar, a significant ST & SC population, large Lingayat and Kuruba population and equally large paddy fields are some!</p>
                <p>Even though JDS has lost most of its base in large parts of North Karnataka, these are the two districts where it has retained its influence to an extent. Hence making most seats of Koppal-Raichur madly Tripolar and very difficult to predict!</p>
                <p>In a stiff Tripolar contest in past 3 election cycles, Congress has always emerged as the winner here. BJP’s performance is limited to 3, 4 & 2 seats in 2004, 08 & 13 respectively. JDS has consistently won 1-2 seats in each district while the rest of the seats have been with Cong</p>
                <p>Although candidate selection to a great extent will influence the final outcome, the net movement of Lingayat & ST voters will be decisive. That said, Congress has a strong base of ST-SC-Muslim-Kuruba votebank here!</p>
                <p>BJP has also lost some of its strong leaders like Manappa Vajjal(Lingsugur) to JDS, Pratapgoud Patil(Maski) & Shivraj Tangadagi(Kanakagiri) to Cong. It also faces strong competition from Cong/JDS leaders like Basavaraj Rayareddi(Yalburga), Iqbal Ansari(Gangavati) et al!</p>
                <p>Although it is difficult to predict some of the seats of Koppal-Raichur districts without the clarity about candidates of JDS & BJP, here’s an attempt to rate the 12 seats of these 2 districts!</p>
                <p>(Observe that there are no ‘safe’ seats for any parties- it is that volatile!)</p>

                <p>With analysis of 12 districts complete, here’s what seats of Mumbai Karnataka, Hyderabad Karnataka(minus Bellary) & Chitradurga look like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total 87 seats</li>
                    <li>Safe BJP 19</li>
                    <li>Lean BJP 27</li>
                    <li>Toss-up 18</li>
                    <li>Lean Cong 17</li>
                    <li>Safe Cong 3</li>
                    <li>Lean JDS 3</li>
